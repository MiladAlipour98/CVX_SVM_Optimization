# CVX_SVM_Optimization
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Optimization and Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) with CVXPY: Solving SVM Problem, Visualizing Decision Boundary, Exploring Duality, and Understanding Convex Expression Composition.
This project focuses on solving the support vector machine (SVM) problem. It involves loading training data, solving the SVM problem using CVX with a specified parameter value, visualizing the decision boundary, exploring duality through a modified problem formulation, and investigating different values of the cost parameter to evaluate misclassification error.
This the error plot:
